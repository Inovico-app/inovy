## 8. Technical Implementation Details

### 8.1 Server Actions Structure

```typescript
// Example server action pattern
export async function createProject(data: CreateProjectInput) {
  // Validation
  // Authentication check
  // Database operation via data access layer
  // Return result with proper error handling
}
```

- Comprehensive error responses

### 8.4 Caching & Performance Strategy

**Redis Cache Implementation**:

- **Session Caching**: User session data and authentication tokens
- **Query Result Caching**: Frequently accessed project lists, AI templates, and user permissions
- **AI Processing Cache**: Cache AI analysis results to avoid reprocessing identical content
- **Transcription Cache**: Store processed transcriptions with TTL based on file modification
- **Organization Data**: Cache organization and team hierarchies for faster access control

**Cache Patterns**:

```typescript
// Example caching pattern
export async function getCachedProjects(organizationId: string) {
  const cacheKey = `projects:${organizationId}`;
  const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);

  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

  const projects = await db.query.projects.findMany({
    where: eq(projects.organizationId, organizationId),
  });

  await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(projects)); // 5min TTL
  return projects;
}
```

**Rate Limiting Strategy**:

- **API Endpoints**: 100 requests per minute per user
- **File Uploads**: 10 uploads per hour per user
- **AI Processing**: 50 requests per hour per organization
- **AI Summary Generation**: 5 requests per minute per user (for generating summaries, action items, insights)
- **Authentication**: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP

**Cache Invalidation**:

- Event-driven cache invalidation on data mutations
- TTL-based expiration for less critical data
- Manual cache clearing for administrative operations

# GitHub Project Setup Guide

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

Run the automated script:

```bash
./setup-github-project-simple.sh
```

This will create the project and add all issues. Then follow the manual configuration steps below.

## Manual Configuration Steps

After running the script, go to your project and configure it:

### 1. Add Custom Fields

Go to Project Settings and add these fields:

#### Sprint (Single Select)

## 4. Set Up Automation (Optional)

Create automation rules:

### Auto-assign to Sprint

- **Trigger**: Item added to project
- **Action**: Set Sprint field based on labels

### Status Updates

- **Trigger**: Pull request opened
- **Action**: Move to "In Progress"

### Completion Tracking

- **Trigger**: Issue closed
- **Action**: Move to "Done"

## 5. Project Management Tips

### Daily Workflow

1. Start each day by checking the Sprint Timeline view
2. Move issues to "In Progress" when starting work
3. Update effort estimates based on actual work
4. Move completed issues to "Done"

### Sprint Planning

1. Use the Priority view to identify high-priority items
2. Check effort distribution across sprints
3. Adjust assignments based on team capacity
4. Review dependencies between issues

### Reporting

1. Use the Table view for progress reporting
2. Filter by Feature Area for technical reviews
3. Group by Assignee for individual workload tracking
4. Export data for external reporting tools

## Troubleshooting

### Issues Not Showing

- Check if issues are added to the project
- Verify view filters aren't hiding issues
- Refresh the browser page

### Custom Fields Not Working

- Ensure fields are created in Project Settings
- Check field types match the data you're entering
- Verify permissions to edit project fields

### Automation Not Triggering

- Check automation rules are enabled
- Verify trigger conditions are met
- Review GitHub Action logs if using workflows

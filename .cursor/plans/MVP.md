## **Pricing Model Considerations:**

Given your usage-based tiering for diverse customers:

**Suggested Pricing Dimensions:**

- **Recording hours per month** (primary metric)
- **Number of users** (secondary)
- **Storage retention period** (30/90/365 days/unlimited)
- **Advanced AI features** (usage-based or tier-based)
- **Integration limits** (number of active integrations)

**Tier Structure Suggestion:**

1. **Starter**: $X/user/month + $Y per recording hour (basic features, 30-day retention)
2. **Professional**: $X/user/month + $Y per recording hour (all standard features, 90-day retention)
3. **Enterprise**: Custom pricing (all features, custom retention, SLA, dedicated support, SSO, advanced compliance)
4. **Government/Healthcare**: Custom (all Enterprise + industry-specific compliance, air-gapped option, professional services)

**Free Tier?** Consider a very limited free tier (10 hours/month, 3 users) to drive adoption with small teams, then upgrade path is natural.

## **Go-To-Market Sequence:**

Given your breadth, I'd recommend a **phased launch**:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6)**: Sales & Product Teams

- Focus on absolutely necessary + must-haves 1-11
- These teams are more forgiving and will provide fast feedback
- Build cloud infrastructure and basic integrations

**Phase 2 (Months 6-12)**: Enterprise & Privacy Features

- Add advanced compliance, redaction, self-hosted deployment
- Target healthcare and government
- Build industry-specific templates

**Phase 3 (Months 12-18)**: AI & Intelligence

- Advanced analytics and industry-specific AI
- Workflow automation
- Knowledge management features

## **Key Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Build vs Buy for Transcription?**

   - Consider: Deepgram, AssemblyAI, or Rev.ai initially
   - Build custom models later for specialized vocabulary

2. **AI Model Strategy:**

   - Use foundation models (GPT-5, Claude) via API initially
   - Offer self-hosted LLM option for sensitive deployments (Llama, Mistral)
   - Build fine-tuned models for industry-specific insights

3. **Database Architecture:**
   - Separate hot/cold storage for cost optimization
   - Consider multi-tenancy for cloud vs isolated for self-hosted
